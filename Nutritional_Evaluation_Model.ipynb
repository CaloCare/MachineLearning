The tuner explores different configurations of the model, including the number of units in the dense layer, and evaluates performance over `50 epochs` using the validation data. After completing the hyperparameter search, the best model is selected based on the highest validation accuracy and evaluated on the validation set to report the loss and accuracy metrics.
